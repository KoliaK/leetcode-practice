# LEETCODE PRACTICES

I decided to create this repository not only to store my coding-challenge solutions but also to keep track of my progress and practice sessions.

# FILES THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL

## 🤖 tutor_prompt.txt
This prompt turns Gemini into a **Algorithms / Data Structure / Python Tutor**, allowing the user to learn and practice common algorithm patterns that are incredibly helpful to develop problem-solving skills.
*(Note: it works well along with Guided Learning mode.)*

## 🧩 data_structures_algorithms.txt
This is a "cheat sheet" document to help me to remember data structure definitions, common algorithm names, and Big O notation. I grab a topic from here and apply it to the prompt in a new conversation with Gemini for a practice session.

## 🌟 Important Considerations!!!
I avoid asking Gemini to "show me the code" at all costs. The only stance where I allow it to generate code is when I've **already** solved the algorithm and I'd like to see a "senior approach" for the same problem.
I stick to my own knowledge to solve the challenges, sometimes googling syntax for specific things without ever looking for pre-written solutions.
I've been improving a lot by working 2~3 challenges a day for the past couple of weeks, so I decided to organize some of my solutions into files, along with the Gemini solutions.

**It really feels like I have someone making me think of my choices while coding and teaching me from my own mistakes instead of just writing solutions for me**

*It definitely feels less lonely to study this way...*
